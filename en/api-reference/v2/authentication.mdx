# Generating Your API Key

To use the Pingo Notify API, you need an API Key. It identifies and authorizes your application.

Key points:

- The API Key is shown only once at creation time.
- Include the key in the `apikey` header on all requests.
- Store the key securely; do not share it in public repositories.

## Create your key — in 3 steps

## Usage — required header

Include the following header in all requests:

`apikey: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`

Note: if the key is lost, generate a new one — the original key will not be shown again.

## Example (cURL)

```bash
curl -s -X POST 'https://api.pingonotify.com/v2/connections/{{id}}/chats/{{remoteJid}}/messages' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'apikey: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' \
  --data '{"text":"Hello — API test","delay":3000}'
```

**Replace the `{{id}}` and `{{remoteJid}}` parameters with the actual values from your environment:**

* **`{{id}}`** → corresponds to the **ID of your connection** created in the Pingo Notify dashboard.  
  It is the unique identifier of the WhatsApp instance you are using.

* **`{{remoteJid}}`** → is the **recipient’s number**, in the international format used by WhatsApp.  
  It represents the person you want to send messages to.

## Checklist

- Did you copy the API Key at creation time?
- Are you sending the `apikey` header in all requests?
- Is the endpoint using `https` in production?

## Security — best practices

- Do not commit the API Key to public source code.
- Store it in environment variables or a secrets vault.
- Rotate keys and remove unused keys.
