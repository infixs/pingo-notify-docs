## Create a connection

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4">

  <Card icon="qrcode" href="https://pingonotify.com/pt-BR/dashboard/connections">
    <h3>1. Access Connections</h3>
    <p>
      Go to the <strong>Connections</strong> tab in the dashboard to view all created integrations.
    </p>
  </Card>

  <Card icon="plus">
    <h3>2. Create a new connection</h3>
    <p>
      Click <strong>Create</strong>, choose a name, and adjust the settings according to your needs.
    </p>
  </Card>

  <Card icon="expand">
    <h3>3. Link to WhatsApp</h3>
    <p>
      After creating the connection, click the <strong>QR Code</strong> icon and scan it using WhatsApp’s QR Code reader.
      This is the same process used by WhatsApp Web.
    </p>
  </Card>

  <Card icon="wifi">
    <h3>4. Connection activated</h3>
    <p>
      After scanning the QR Code, the status will update automatically and the connection will become active.
    </p>
  </Card>

</div>

<Warning icon="triangle-exclamation">Keep WhatsApp active on the linked device.</Warning>

## Configure Webhooks

After creating your connection, you can configure webhooks to receive real-time events directly on your HTTPS endpoint.

<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4">

  <Card icon="link" href="https://pingonotify.com/dashboard/webhooks">
    <h3>1. Define the Webhook URL</h3>
    <p>
      Provide the HTTPS URL of your endpoint.  
      This is the route where Pingo Notify will send all selected events.
    </p>
  </Card>

  <Card icon="list">
    <h3>2. Select webhook events</h3>
    <p>
      Choose which events you want to listen to.  
      The list includes actions such as messages sent, received, edited, and more.
    </p>
  </Card>

  <Card icon="toggle-on">
    <h3>3. Enable or disable the Webhook</h3>
    <p>
      Use the <strong>“Webhook status”</strong> switch to enable or pause event delivery without deleting the configuration.
    </p>
  </Card>

  <Card icon="layer-group">
    <h3>4. Message grouping</h3>
    <p>
      The <strong>“Enable message grouping”</strong> option reduces the number of requests by grouping events over a time interval.
    </p>
  </Card>

  <Card icon="keyboard">
    <h3>5. Typing simulation</h3>
    <p>
      The <strong>“Enable typing simulation”</strong> option sends “typing…” signals to WhatsApp, mimicking human behavior.
    </p>
  </Card>

  <Card icon="timer">
    <h3>6. Grouping interval</h3>
    <p>
      If grouping is enabled, set the time (in seconds) to collect multiple events before sending them in a single payload.
    </p>
  </Card>

## Available Events

The events listed represent everything the system can send to your webhook.  
Below is an explanation of each one:

<Steps>

  <Step title="Message sent">
    Triggered when **your integration sends a message** via WhatsApp.  
    Includes data such as message ID, content, recipient, and timestamp.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Message received">
    Triggered when **a message arrives on the connected WhatsApp**.  
    Includes text, media, sender, and origin metadata.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Message updated">
    Occurs when a message changes — for example, when WhatsApp updates its internal status.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Message deleted">
    Sent when a message is deleted (either by you or by the sender).  
    Useful for UI synchronization.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Message edited">
    Triggered when an existing message is edited on WhatsApp, a recent platform feature.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Presence updated">
    Indicates changes in the contact’s presence state (typing, recording audio, online, etc.).
  </Step>

</Steps>

All events are sent via JSON POST requests, enabling fast processing and integration with any backend.
