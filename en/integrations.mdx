## What are integrations?

An **integration** is the link between **Pingo Notify** and an **external application**, such as a plugin, system, or platform.

<Info>
  An integration **is not a WhatsApp session**.  
  It is the authorization that allows an application to access Pingo Notify.
</Info>

Through an integration, an application can securely and controllably interact with the messaging system.

---

## What are integrations used for?

Integrations allow external applications to:

- Send messages  
- Access available connections  
- Query plan information  
- Use messaging resources  
- Operate within the granted permissions  

Without an active integration, the application **cannot access Pingo Notify**.

---

## What does this screen show?

The **Integrations** screen displays **all applications already linked** to your Pingo Notify account.

Each item in the list represents:

- An integrated application (e.g., WordPress)  
- An active authorization  
- A valid link to the messaging system  

---

## Example: WordPress integration

When you integrate the **WordPress plugin** with Pingo Notify:

- WordPress becomes an **integration**  
- The WordPress account gains access to the messaging system  
- The plugin can:
  - List connections  
  - Use active connections  
  - Query plan information  
  - Send messages based on site events  

<Info>
  The integration grants access.  
  The connection defines which WhatsApp will be used.
</Info>

## Integration vs Connection

<Callout icon="circle-info">
- **Integration**: link with the application (e.g., WordPress)  
- **Connection**: WhatsApp session (QR Code scanned)  
</Callout>

An integration can use **one or more connections**, depending on the configuration.

---

## What can I do with an integration?

On this screen, you can:

- View which applications are integrated  
- Identify the source of access (e.g., plugin, system, API)  
- Control which applications have access to Pingo Notify  
- Revoke integrations that should no longer access the system  

---

## Important to know

<Warning>
  If an integration is removed or disabled,  
  the linked application immediately loses access to Pingo Notify.
</Warning>

This does not remove connections or messages; it only blocks the application’s access.

---

## Summary

<Info>
  - Integration = application access authorization  
  - WordPress plugin is an example of an integration  
  - Integrations access connections and plan resources  
  - Without an integration, the application does not work  
</Info>

Before an application can send messages or manage connections, it must be integrated with Pingo Notify.
