## What are API Keys?

**API Keys** are **access keys** that identify and authorize applications to use Pingo Notify.

<Info>
  Think of API Keys as a **special password for systems**,  
  not for people.
</Info>

They ensure that only authorized applications can access your account and send messages on your behalf.

## What are API Keys used for?

API Keys allow an application to:

- Access your Pingo Notify account  
- Use messaging resources  
- Query permitted information  
- Perform actions securely  

Without a valid key, access is blocked.

## How it works in practice

<Info>
  Simple flow:  
  **Application → API Key → Pingo Notify**
</Info>

Whenever an application tries to communicate with Pingo Notify, the API Key is used to validate access.

## Creating API Keys

API Keys are created directly in the Pingo Notify dashboard.

Important points:

- The key is displayed **only once**  
- It cannot be viewed again  
- If lost, a new one must be generated  

---

## Security best practices

- Do not share your API Key  
- Do not publish the key in public places  
- Store it securely  
- Remove keys that are no longer in use

## Quick summary

<Info>
  - API Keys control access to your account  
  - They are used by applications, not people  
  - They must be kept secure  
</Info>

Whenever an application needs to access Pingo Notify, it will require a valid API Key.
