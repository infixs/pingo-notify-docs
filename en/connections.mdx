## What is a connection?

A **connection** is an **active WhatsApp session** linked to Pingo Notify, similar to WhatsApp Web.

<Info>
  It is a session scanned via QR Code,  
  but **named**, **manageable**, and with **advanced controls**.
</Info>

Each connection corresponds to one connected WhatsApp account.

---

## What are they used for?

Connections are the foundation of everything in Pingo Notify.  
They allow you to:

- Send and receive messages  
- Process events  
- Use plugins, webhooks, and APIs  
- Control session behavior  

Without an active connection, no integration works.

---

## What can I do with a connection?

- Link a WhatsApp account via QR Code  
- Name the session  
- Use the same connection across multiple integrations  
- Configure webhooks  
- Adjust rules for reading, presence, and calls  

Each connection is independent.

## Edit connection

The **Edit connection** screen defines **how the WhatsApp session behaves**.

<Info>
  Changes affect only the selected connection.
</Info>

### Connection name

Internal name for identification.

- Organizational only  
- Does not change the WhatsApp account  

**Examples:** `Support`, `Sales`, `Finance`
