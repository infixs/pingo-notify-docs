## What are Webhooks?

Webhooks allow **Pingo Notify to notify your application** whenever something happens on WhatsApp.

<Info>
  Think of webhooks as automatic alerts sent to your system.
</Info>

Whenever an event occurs, Pingo Notify sends this information to a URL configured by you.

---

## Connections and Webhooks

<Info>
  The relationship between connections and webhooks is flexible.
</Info>

- A connection can be linked to multiple webhooks  
- A webhook can receive events from multiple connections  

This allows different integration combinations, depending on your system’s needs.

---

## When should you use Webhooks?

Use webhooks when you want to:

- Receive notifications about sent or received messages  
- Automate processes based on WhatsApp  
- Update systems in real time  
- Integrate WhatsApp with other applications  

If you only send messages, using webhooks is optional.

## How it works

<Info>
  Basic flow:  
  **WhatsApp → Connection → Pingo Notify → Webhook → Your application**
</Info>

Whenever something happens on any linked connection, the event is sent to the webhook.
